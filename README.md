# Atlas-Babad-Tanah-Jawi
This is my final project for my personal undergraduate thesis at Geodetic Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada (2016). This online map is produced as a historical interactive atlas that helps users understand the historical flow of the Islamic Mataram Kingdom and its historical locations.
The map is a developed version of analog map (hardcopy) to web-based map. I modified the map with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used Mapbox Studio to customize the background map and Mapbox.js and Leaflet as a javascript library for interactivity on the atlas.
